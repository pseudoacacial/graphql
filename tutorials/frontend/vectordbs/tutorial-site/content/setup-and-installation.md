## Overview

This tutorial will walk you through setting up a fullstack VectorDB application using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and
Hasura. We have a specific image and [Data Connector](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/data-connectors/) for
Hasura that will enable you to add a VectorDB instance to your Hasura GraphQL API.

The following pages in this section will help you clone the repository, set up your environment, configure your local
Postgres database, and vectorize data using Weaviate. Once you've completed this section, you'll be ready to connect to
Hasura and build your application.
