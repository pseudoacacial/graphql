The easiest way to bring live data to your UI is using the `useSubscription()` method from `@vue/apollo-composable`. Each subscription created with `useSubscription()` in a component results in the creation of a reactive subscription object.

One thing to note, subscriptions in `vue-apollo` are just listeners, they donâ€™t request any data when first connected, but only open up a connection to get new data. But in Hasura GraphQL Engine, subscriptions are live queries. The initial request gives back data, if any, for the subscription.
