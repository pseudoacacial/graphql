Anyone who's built an API knows that most of the time spent creating it is centered around writing access control rules
to meet security and compliance requirements. Hasura v3 is a powerful tool that allows you to build a production-ready,
compliant GraphQL API in minutes, not weeks.

Hasura was created to help developers build APIs faster. It's a powerful tool that allows you to build a
production-ready GraphQL API. Hasura v3 is the latest version of Hasura and is a complete rewrite of the Hasura
architecture. It's faster, more powerful, and more flexible than ever before.

## What will I learn? {#what-will-i-learn}

This tutorial is designed to give you a complete overview of Hasura v3 and its capabilities. By the end of this
tutorial, you will have a working Hasura v3 project deployed to [Hasura DDN](https://console.hasura.io), our global and
near-instant data delivery network.

You'll learn how to:

1. Create a new Hasura project.
2. Author declarative metadata that defines your entire API.
3. Connect a data source using Hasura's data connectors.
4. Configure fine-grained access control rules for your API.
5. Deploy a development build of your API to Hasura DDN.
6. Test your API using the Hasura Console.
7. Deploy a production build of your API to Hasura DDN.

## What will we be building? {#what-will-we-be-building}

We'll build an e-commerce API that allows users to manage their orders and notifications. The API will be backed by a
PostgreSQL database and will be deployed to Hasura DDN.
