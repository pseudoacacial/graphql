metaDescription: "In this section, we'll cover how to set up permissions for the users model for select operations."

We'll begin by creating `ModelPermissions` for the `users` model. We'll create a `user` role and add a filter that will
only allow users to see their own information.

## Enable Auto-select

In our browser, let's select the auto-select latest build option. This will ensure we're always seeing the latest build
generated by the `dev` command:

## Add ModelPermission

For our `users` model, we want to introduce an authorization concept we call
[**permissions**](https://haura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/permissions/). This allows you to control which models
are accessible to which users — via a **model permission** — and which fields can be returned using **type
permissions**.

Presently, if we run the following query, we'll see all users' information returned:

```graphql
query UsersQuery {
  app_users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

In just a few lines — and with the assistance of [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) powering
our [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) — we can declaratively restrict
access so that a user is only able to see a limited set of their own data.

Open your project in VS Code and find the `/app/app_connector/models/Users.hml` file.

As you can see below, when we start typing `role`, LSP kicks in and assists us with creating the following permission
which checks the `x-hasura-user-id` header to only return a specific user's information. We're triggering the
auto-complete options using `TAB` and `CTRL+SPACE`:

With the guidance of LSP, let's make our `ModelPermissions` object look like the metadata below in our `Users.hml` file:

```yaml
---
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
```

## What just happened?

### Permissions

With only a few lines of YAML, you added row-level column-level permissions to your API. You can learn more about how to
pass these values as session variables using your preferred authentication solution in our
[auth section](https://haura.io/docs/3.0/auth/overview/).

Next, we'll check out how we can restrict access to specific **fields** based on role.
