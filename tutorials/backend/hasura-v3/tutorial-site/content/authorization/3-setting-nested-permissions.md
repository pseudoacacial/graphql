One of the greatest benefits of GraphQL is the ability to perform nested queries across types â€” all from a single query!
For this, you can also implement permissions.

Imagine wanting to execute the following query:

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
    orders {
      id
      created_at
      status
      delivery_date
    }
    notifications {
      id
      message
      created_at
      updated_at
    }
  }
}
```

In order to do this, we'll need to set up permissions for the `orders` and `notifications` models.

## Orders

### ModelSelectPermissions

Begin by finding the `ModelPermissions` for your `orders` table:

```yaml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: orders
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
```

We'll add a filter to compare the `x-hasura-user-id` session variable to the `user_id` field on the `orders` table.

The complete `ModelPermissions` for `orders` should look like this:

```yaml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: orders
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: user_id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
```

### TypePermissions

You can search for the `TypePermissions` for your `orders` table:

```yaml
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: orders
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - created_at
          - delivery_date
          - id
          - is_reviewed
          - product_id
          - status
          - updated_at
          - user_id
```

We'll let the user see all fields for their orders, so our final `TypePermissions` for `orders` should look like this:

```yaml
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: orders
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - created_at
          - delivery_date
          - id
          - is_reviewed
          - product_id
          - status
          - updated_at
          - user_id
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - created_at
          - delivery_date
          - id
          - is_reviewed
          - product_id
          - status
          - updated_at
          - user_id
```

## Notifications

We'll repeat the process for our `notifications` table:

## ModelSelectPermissions

After modifying the `ModelPermissions` for your `notifications` table, it should look like this:

```yaml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: notifications
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: user_id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
```

## TypePermissions

Finally, we'll modify the `TypePermissions` for our `notifications` table:

```yaml
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: notifications
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - created_at
          - id
          - message
          - updated_at
          - user_id
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - created_at
          - id
          - message
          - updated_at
          - user_id
```

## Test the new permissions

Then, run the query in the Console, ensuring that you have the `x-hasura-role` and `x-hasura-user-id` headers set:

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
    orders {
      id
      created_at
      status
      delivery_date
    }
    notifications {
      id
      message
      created_at
      updated_at
    }
  }
}
```

You'll see that you can only see the orders and notifications for the user you're logged in as. ðŸŽ‰
