## Create a build

As you've been using `ddn dev` to watch for changes in your project, you've been creating builds. Do note that you can
also do this manually, such as during a CI/CD pipeline, [using the CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/build/).

When you create a build, you're building both the connectors for a project and the updated supergraph itself. Under the
hood, `ddn dev` automates two commands:
[`ddn build connector-manifest`](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/build-connector-manifest) and
[`ddn build supergraph-manifest`](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/build-supergraph-manifest).

For ease, we'll take the last autogenerated build from `ddn dev` and apply it to our project's endpoint.

## Apply a build

To apply a build, you'll need to use the `ddn apply` command. This command will apply the build to your project's
endpoint and will make it accessible to anyone who has access to the project's endpoint.

First, we'll get a list of all the builds in our project:

```bash
ddn get supergraph-build
```

Take the latest build version and apply it to your project's endpoint:

```bash
ddn apply supergraph-build <build-version>
```

And that's it! You've successfully created and applied a build to your project.
