This course is for Hasura users who want to learn about various Authorization patterns to use in their applications for production use cases. If you are new to Hasura, head to the [Hasura Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) tutorial to set up a Hasura project and learn how to leverage the fundamental features before diving into this tutorial.

## What will I learn? {#what-will-i-learn}

This course will dive into advanced topics and walk you through using different Authorization patterns. You will learn how Hasura Cloud helps you go to production with advanced security features. The topics covered are:

1. Authorization Patterns in Multi-tenant system
2. The case for Multiple JWT Secrets
3. Using Inherited Roles
4. When would you need backend-only permissions?
5. Permissions in Data Federation
6. Comparison with Zanzibar

## What do I need to take this tutorial? {#what-do-i-need}

Some demos use a local Hasura instance; hence, `docker / docker-compose` is a prerequisite. And, of course, your browser for managing the Hasura Cloud project. However, be assured that everything you do via the browser in this tutorial can be done via code and can be version controlled if required.

## How long will this tutorial take? {#how-long}

The tutorial has multiple authorization patterns, all independent to each other and hence you can pick one track and explore how to apply those principles in your app's use case.

*Note*: Some security features are available only on Hasura Cloud. The open-source graphql-engine can be used for local development portions of this tutorial.
