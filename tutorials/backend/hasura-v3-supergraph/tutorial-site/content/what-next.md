Congratulations! You have successfully completed the course.

We took you from start to finish on how to build your data supergraph with Hasura. In less than ninety minutes, you
created a secure, scalable, and production-ready GraphQL API that can be deployed to users around the world â€” instantly.

In case you are wondering what to do next, you have the following options:

## Check out the docs

While we linked to them throughout the guide, we recommend picking up these sections next:

- [Configuring authentication](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/authentication/overview/)
- [Building your own data connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/connectors/overview/)
- [Using the CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/ci-cd/overview/)

## Visit the Data Connector Hub

The [Data Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) is a repository of data connectors for Hasura. You can find one
for your favorite data source or, if it's not there, you can build your own!

## Join Discord for Support {#join-discord}
