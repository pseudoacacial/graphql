This course is a quick introduction to developing backend applications in various languages. We also show how to integrate them with [Hasura GraphQL](https://hasura.io/).

When developing backend applications, especially ones with GraphQL, there are many things you need to worry about, such as security, performance, and the manual labor of creating CRUD operations.

Hasura reduces the bulk of this complexity of setting up a GraphQL API from scratch by giving you instant GraphQL CRUD for databases covering most of the data fetching and real-time subscription use cases. When you need to run custom business logic, Hasura lets you extend your graph in multiple ways.

## Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

You should be familiar with your language of choice. If you are new to Hasura and want to integrate, we recommend you go over the [Introduction to Hasura](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) Course before taking this.
